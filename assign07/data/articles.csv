"Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting","This paper explores deep learning models for forecasting time series data.","","arXiv:2511.15112","The innovation of the study is that the deep learning method and sentiment analysis are integrated in traditional business model analysis and forecasting, and the research subject is TSMC for industry trend prediction of semiconductor industry in Taiwan. For the rapid market changes and development of wafer technologies of semiconductor industry, traditional data analysis methods not perform well in the high variety and time series data. Textual data and time series data were collected from seasonal reports of TSMC including financial information. Textual data through sentiment analysis by considering the event intervention both from internal events of the company and the external global events. Using the sentiment-enhanced time series data, the LSTM model was adopted for predicting industry trend of TSMC. The prediction results reveal significant development of wafer technology of TSMC and the potential threatens in the global market, and matches the product released news of TSMC and the international news. The contribution of the work performed accurately in industry trend prediction of the semiconductor industry by considering both the internal and external event intervention, and the prediction results provide valuable information of semiconductor industry both in research and business aspects","Lyn Chao-Ling Chen","PhD"
"Graph Neural Networks: A Review","Comprehensive review of graph neural networks and their applications.","","arXiv:2511.15469","Security-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow (SC DCOPF) is an important tool for transmission system operators, enabling economically efficient and physically secure dispatch decisions. Although CPU-based commercial solvers (e.g., Gurobi) can efficiently solve SC-DCOPF problems with a reasonable number of security constraints, their performance degrades rapidly as both system size and the number of contingencies grow into thousands, leading to a significant computational burden. This introduces a bottleneck for system operators who seek timely decision-making across a wide range of potential threats. In this paper, we design a computational graph representation of the SC-DCOPF-based market-clearing problem, inspired by the third ARPA-E Grid Optimization Competition (GO3). We are able to quickly bound the optimal solution of large-scale SC-DCOPF problems using a GPU-accelerated Neural Network verification tool called Interval Bound Propagation (IBP). Using IBP, we compute certified bounds with a maximum gap of 6.53% for instances up to 617 buses, while demonstrating scalability on challenging systems up to 8,316 buses with a runtime of approximately 0.07 seconds. These results demonstrate that IBP can provide high-quality solution bounds at very fast speeds, and it can help identify infeasibility drivers in challenging SC-DCOPF instances..","Xiangxin Kong","PhD"
"Astrophysics","The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Cross-correlation of kSZ and continuity equation velocity reconstruction with photometric DESI LRGs.","","arXiv:2511.15701","Over the last year, kinematic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction -- the measurement of the large-scale velocity field using the anisotropic statistics of the small-scale kSZ-galaxy overdensity correlation -- has emerged as a statistically significant probe of the large-scale Universe. In this work, we perform a 2-dimensional tomographic reconstruction using ACT DR6 CMB data and DESI legacy luminous red galaxies (LRGs).","Fiona McCarthy","PhD"
